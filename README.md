<h3>Product Information</h3><br> <p> Gear Generator is a tool for creating involute spur gears. The Gear Generator may compose full gear layouts with connected gears to design multiple gears system with control of than be input/output ratio and rotation speed. Gears can be animated at various speeds to demonstrate working mechanisms. Gear Generator can be accessed <a href="https://geargenerator.com/">here.</a> </p>

<h3>Description</h3><br> <p>This script automates the testing of gear generator functionality using Playwright. After launching a Chromium browser, it navigates to the Gear Generator site. Then it reads gear parameters from a JSON file (gear.json or GearLimits.json). The script handles multiple test cases, iterating through each one to test the functionality, usability, and accuracy of the application features. After executing each test case, it captures a screenshot of the generated gear configuration. After completing each test case, it closes the browser. This automated process efficiently tests various gear configuration in a shorter time frame. By providing the screenshots of the generated results, it enables detailed analysis. </p><br>
<h3>Test Results</h3><br> <p> The application appears to be stable and functional. The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.<br>
The functionality of the Gear Generator application is working as expected. The application successfully handles single gear with accurate details but also supports adding multiple gears and each gear is added correctly with the specified details. The interaction between the input fields and the output is correct. All fields (Number of teeth, Diametral pitch, Pitch diameter, Pressure Angle) are functioning as intended.
