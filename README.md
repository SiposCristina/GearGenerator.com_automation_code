<h3>Description</h3><br> <p>This script automates the testing of gear generator functionality using Playwright. After launching a Chromium browser, it navigates to the Gear Generator site. Then it reads gear parameters from a JSON file. The script handles multiple test cases, iterating through each one to test the functionality, accuracy and reliability of the application features. After executing each test case, it captures a screenshot of the generated gear configuration. After completing each test case, it closes the browser. This automated process efficiently tests various gear configuration in a shorter time frame. By providing the screenshots of the generated results, it enables detailed analysis. </p><br>
